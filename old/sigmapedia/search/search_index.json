Conversations with this longer form became less and less zesty. </p>"},{"location":"concepts/rizz/#revival-and-betrayal","title":"Revival and betrayal","text":"<p>Interestingly, almost out of nowhere, rizz was repopularised by actor Tom Holland. It is often rumored that he is the aroused spirit of Kai Cenat, but this has been disproven. In fact, some believe he was a Skibidian, although this too has been disproven. It is likely he had only heard the term from a dedicated Sigler friend, and spread it throughout the world. Now, it is widely used, but we are yet to wait for its even truer meaning, in the Sigma Grind, to be fully redispersed.</p>"},{"location":"concepts/meta/","title":"Meta Concepts","text":"<p>These are concepts that are used to talk specifically about Sigmism as a religion.</p>"},{"location":"concepts/meta/sigmapedia/","title":"Sigmapedia","text":"<p>Sigmapedia is the official unofficial wiki and encyclopedia of Sigmism, brought to you by the official Church of Sigma.
